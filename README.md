## Silakka54 layout

My own keyboard layout for the Silakka54 split keyboard. It uses eight layers – four for macOS and four for Windows which are mostly the same with some minor differences because of the different modifiers. It also has some quirks that come in handy when you're a graphic designer like me e.g. the second space bar and the CMD/CTRL keys on the thumbs.

I also included the files for the visual represantation.
